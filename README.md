# SynapseServerlessDacpacBuilder

> **NOTE**
> [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes) introduced vative support by SSDT for Serverless SQL pool.

This repository contains a sample console application that builds [DACPAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/data-tier-applications/data-tier-applications) files for [Synapse Serverless SQL pool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/on-demand-workspace-overview) from SQL source files.

The DACPAC file generated by the tool can be published to Synapse Serverless SQL pool using [SqlPackage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlpackage/sqlpackage-for-azure-synapse-analytics).

## Usage

The tool builds a DACPAC file (also referred to as package) based on the SQL files under a specified folder (also referred to as source or root folder).

The source folder is scanned recursively and all files with `.sql` extension are added to the package.

The tool processes the current folder, unless specified otherwise with the `--source` option.

The name of the DACPAC file can be set using the `--output` option, with a default of `./package.dacpac`.

You can also specify a name to be added to the package's metadata using the `--name` option, with a default of `package`.
